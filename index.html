                  HMO (Health Maintenance Organization): Requires you to choose
                  a primary care physician (PCP) and get referrals from them to
                  see specialists. Care is typically only covered if you use
                  doctors and hospitals within the HMO network.
                </li>
                <li>
                  PPO (Preferred Provider Organization): Offers more
                  flexibility. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist,
                  and you can see out-of-network doctors, though at a higher
                  cost. PPOs generally have higher premiums than HMOs.

                  A deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket for
                  healthcare services before your insurance begins to cover
                  costs. For example, if your deductible is $1,000, you’ll need
                  to pay that amount for covered services before your insurance
                  starts contributing. Some services, like preventive care, may
                  be covered before the deductible is met.

                  deductible. It applies to certain healthcare services like
                  doctor visits, prescriptions, or emergency room visits.

                  Coinsurance is the percentage of costs you share with your
                  insurance company after you've met your deductible. For
                  example, if your coinsurance is 20%, and you’ve met your
                  deductible, the insurance company will cover 80% of the cost
                  of covered services, and you’ll pay 20%. This applies until
                  you reach your out-of-pocket maximum.

                  The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you'll pay in a policy
                  period (typically a year) for covered healthcare services.
                  Once you reach this limit, the insurance company will cover
                  100% of your covered services for the rest of the policy
                  period. This includes your deductible, copays, and coinsurance
                  but does not include your premiums.
